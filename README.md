# Phantasy Engine Testbed (CUDA Ray Tracing Experiment)

__NOTE: THIS IS DEPRECATED!__ This is a precursor to the current Phantasy Engine, which should be linked to somewhere on PetorSFZ's github profile.

## About

This started of as the initial work on a game engine called Phantasy Engine. Later it turned into a joint effort by me (Peter Hillerstr√∂m - [PetorSFZ](https://github.com/PetorSFZ)), Niklas Helmertz ([helmertz](https://github.com/helmertz)) and Johan Hasselqvist ([Hasselmannen](https://github.com/Hasselmannen)) to build a real-time raytracer in CUDA as a school project.

The current branch (master) is essentially the state we left the project in, a promising start but a lot of way to go. A lot of issues are known, a lot of things are unfinished. It's probably not worth the effort to attempt to build the engine, a pre-compiled binary is available under releases if you want to try it out.

Some features of the CUDA ray tracer:

* Static scene stored in an SBVH
* Really optimized ray traversal
* TAA to reduce noise

## Building

Create a directory called `build`, then run the following command:

	cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" -DCUDA_TRACER=TRUE -DPHANTASY_ENGINE_BUILD_TESTS=TRUE

The `CUDA_TRACER` variable controls whether the CUDA ray tracer backend is built or not. If you don't have a CUDA compatible card this should not be enabled. The `PHANTASY_ENGINE_BUILD_TESTS` variable controls whether the tests are built or not.
